====== IP Address automatic ban ======

This plugin allows you to automatically ban users, through their IP address,
which attempt a bruteforce attack on this wiki's login page. Depending on your
configuration, the IP address may be banned from viewing the whole wiki or just
the login page.

This admin part is for you to have a list of currently banned IP addresses. You
can also delete IP addresses if you think this was an error from the plugin.
