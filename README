dokuwiki-tokenbucketauth
========================

DokuWiki plugin to prevent brute force attacks by delaying them.

An IP address failing too many times to authenticate will be banned from the login form a configurable amount of time (10 minutes by default).

An email can be sent to a configurable email address when an IP has just been banned.

Current version: 0.5
