dokuwiki-tokenbucketauth
========================

DokuWiki plugin to prevent brute force attacks by delaying them.

An IP address failing too many times to authenticate will be banned from the login form a configurable amount of time (10 minutes by default).

An email can be sent to a configurable email address when an IP has just been banned.


ChangeLog
=========

0.1 Functionnal plugin (well, it's blocking IP addresses at least)

0.2 Bugfix: @IP@ & @DOKUWIKIURL@ in mails now replaced
    Bugfix: No more email when a banned user is already banned and want to see again the login form
    Bugfix: Now a user is banned for his/her failed attempts, not for his/her viewing the login page

0.3 Plugin renaming
